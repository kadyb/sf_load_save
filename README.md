# How to load and save spatial vector data in R?

[In this tutorial](https://kadyb.github.io/sf_load_save/tutorial.html) you will
learn how to load and save spatial vector data in R using the
[**sf**](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) package, including the most popular
formats: shapefile (.shp), GeoPackage (.gpkg) and GeoJSON (.geojson). In addition,
you will find here more advanced examples of using GDAL Virtual File Systems to
facilitate data loading, and spatial and non-spatial data preselection using SQL
queries.
